# boston-housing-price-prediction-using-ML-

I am using the boston housing data which is freely avalaible dataset in scikit-learn library. 

I am going to apply **Linear Regression** and query out feautres which contribute the best to the model we create.

I am also going to deploy the model in Heroku as well as Docker.
